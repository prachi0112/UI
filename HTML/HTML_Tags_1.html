    <!-- Block vs Inline Tags in HTML -->
    <!-- 
    An inline element does not cause a line break (start on a new line) and does not take up the full width of a page, only the space bounded by its opening and closing tag. It is usually used within other HTML elements.
    Examples of inline elements are:
    anchor <a> tag
    emphasis <em> tag
    image <img> tag 
    A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width of a page, from left to right. A block-level element can take up one line or multiple lines and has a line break before and after the element.
    Examples of the block-level tag are:
    Heading tags <h1> to <h6>
    List (Ordered, Unordered, Description and List Item) tags <ol> , <ul> ,<dl> , <li>
    Pre-formatted text tag <pre>
    Blockquote tag <blockquote>
    -->
<br>
    Block 
        - occupy full screen width or area available to them
        - eg :- h1, h2...h6, p, div, form, table, ul, li
    <br>
    Inline
        - occupy area only according to the content
        - eg:- a, span, b, i, em, u, small
        - Height and width of an inline tag is - auto*auto
    <br>
    NOTE : Never put a block tag inside an inline tag except "a" tag (Sometimes we have to make the whole block clickable)

    <!-- The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code. -->
